**Quotes On Design Generator**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

As a way to get more familiar with the MERN stack, I decided to build a simple quote generator which gives the user a new quote on demand. He can then tweet it to his followers.

**Tech used :**
- React for the front-end
- Axios to make request to the quotesondesign API and twitter API

**Installation guide :**
- Download or clone the repo to your computer
- Open the terminal and access the location where the repo has been downloaded/cloned
- Run npm install to download the different modules
- Run npm start

*I have included the API keys for testing purposes and might be removed at any time.*
